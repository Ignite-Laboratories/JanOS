// Tiny is a database that generates names satisfying tiny's implicit naming requirements.
// Currently, these are our explicit filters -
//
//   - Only the standard 26 letters of the English alphabet (case-insensitive)
//   - No whitespace or special characters (meaning only single word alpha-explicit names)
//   - At least three characters in length
//   - At least 2ยนโด unique names before beginning to recycling names
//   - Names are case-sensitive in uniqueness.
//
// These filters will never be reduced - if any changes are made, they will only be augmented.
