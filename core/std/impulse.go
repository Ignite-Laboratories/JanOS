// An Impulse represents the act of a synaptic event between a cortex and neuron.  This contains several key points:
//
// Bridge - This is the named synaptic bridge between the cortex and neuron (for tracing purposes)
//
// # TimelineOld - This holds the temporal activation information for this neuron
//
// # Count - This indicates the number of activations that this Synapse has processed
//
// Cortex - This provides a reference to the cortex that generated this impulse (the neuron can be impulsed by many cortices)
//
// Neural - This provides a reference to the neuron that this impulse terminates into.
//
// Thought - This holds the actual impulse data that -this- synaptic bridge has been accumulating across time.  Only the neuron
// understands how to interpret the information contained in the impulsive thought.
