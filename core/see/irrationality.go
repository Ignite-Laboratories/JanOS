# " 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 "

𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑦 has a unique take on irrationality.  We don't ignore it, but we accept that the ability to track an irrational
through changes in precision is, well, something we aspire to reach in the future.  To do so involves symbolically
tracking how an irrational identity was derived across calculations, and how future operations might affect that
identity.  JanOS's lexicographical engine is currently in development - but, regardless, how much of that is REALLY
necessary!?
