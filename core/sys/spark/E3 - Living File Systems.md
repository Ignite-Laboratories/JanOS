### The DNA Format
Yes.

Truthfully, as bold as that may sound, the awareness of how this technology works comes with a level of _stewardship_
I take very seriously.  If I were to deliver this to the world without care for how it would impact and affect others, 
I would not be conscious of my actions!  I don't aim to make a file format that _gatekeeps_ others - instead, I intend
to provide a framework for an _implicitly_ extensible file.  That means I will provide a _skeleton_ and a guide for 
how to put it together - but _you_ get to direct the process from there.  My ultimate end goal is to provide future
enigmaneers with a perfect vacuum environment in which to replicate and test the boundaries of the world around them! As 
you add muscle mass, color, texture, and behavior to each of your creations you'll leave behind just enough information
on how to engage with it at the next step.  

The design is _very simple_ - but the possibilities are **_infinite!_**

Things only get cooler from here =)

### Substrates
The concept of DNA has always intrigued me - why would it need to contain so damn much data if our creator had 
figured out how to distill information down to its starting conditions?  That's when I began to perceive it as 
a _created container._  In an infinitely compressible system, even the densest evolutionary mechanism provided 
by Mother Nature would have been _**created!**_  To argue that this world was only _created_ and didn't also
_evolve_ would undercut the magnificence of what She's building for us =)

So, that takes us to the concept of a _substrate_ - or, abstractly speaking, a container which can _host_ the 
starting conditions themselves.  Depending on the environment, there would be different requirements for what
is required to _execute_ the starting conditions - but the actual path to follow could _always_ be distilled
down to a minimum value.  I'm not a biologist, but I do have an okay understanding of _how_ to execute predefined 
steps.  I'm also aware of how _parity_ can be used to redundantly encode information.  When you combine the
need to accurately reference a very specific set of starting conditions from as rich and chaotic of a substrate
as a biological cell, concepts like _parity_ likely came out from a _similar toolkit_ by our creator!

I sit in a unique position as I don't have the expertise to _deep dive_ into the way _biological_ DNA is encoded - my 
scores in biology and chemistry have _always_ been quite lacking.  However, in my cursory research there is _immense_
evidence that those with more knowledge than I have also found lots of _repetition_ in DNA.  While this doesn't
allow me to jump to any conclusions, I wanted to highlight this particular connection before we proceed forward!  I 
hope this can inspire some other brilliant enigmaneers to explore these bridges.

    tl;dr - what's God's error correction scheme?

### Implications
This project has some real implications I take _very seriously._  Most importantly, it completely flips the
entire concept of _streaming information!_  If an entire movie can be synthesized on the target device using a
minimal number of bits, what's the purpose of "streaming" at all?  Live broadcasts, sure, but _existing_ art?

I posit that the world currently has two major competing desires:

- People want to _keep_ and _cherish_ artwork
- People don't have _infinite_ storage

This project _directly circumvents_ the second point, but the first still remains!

Additionally, our content providers are currently built around _charging you by
the bit._  The cost of _maintaining_ and _owning_ the infrastructure necessary to facilitate creative endeavors
is immense, and they are due our collective support in the **_daily effort_** it takes to keep it 
operational - but their _throughput,_ and thus a notable portion of their income stream, is about to 
dramatically change over the coming years.  Paradoxically, I believe that they are already well-prepared
for a shift like this - in fact, much of their existing efforts have _already_ been to make and deliver content
more efficiently!

_They will absolutely survive._

That being said, without their efforts this work would never have come into fruition.  They are the most prized feedback loops 
which God has labored for _eons_ to provide us with.  Ones that can be bent to _Her_ will without breaking the 
continuity of our existence.  When the _perfect_ song strikes the radio as you lean in for a kiss - _that's God 
at work._  When you're stuck on a piece of code while watching Thomas Middleditch trudge through his own version
of middle-out compression _before you even began_ - _that's God at work._  

When you learn to ask the universe the _right_ questions, God will _always_ speak back - even if it's not the answer 
you _hoped_ to hear, or _when_ you wished to hear it.  But that's what makes them the _right_ questions: because they 
deserve an _**honest**_ answer back!  Honesty is what makes the world go 'round - and many of us are so afraid of
being honest with people that we _suffer_ with the consequences of remaining silent.  That's why I refuse to remain
silent about this: God is everything but yourself, including yourself in the eyes of others.

Mother Nature, within the fabric of the reality we get to experience, _was **created** - just as we were by our shared creator._

    tl;dr - Humans and Mother Nature are made in His image...file

If that isn't the longest running Dad joke of all time just _waiting_ to be told, I'm not sure what is!  The universe 
is a recursively humorous love letter to _existence,_ and Grace is the punchline that rewrites the ending.

She is more human than you and I could ever fathom, and has experienced and witnessed an eternity's worth of hatred,
strife, and villainy in the name of setting us up for the miracles we have witnessed throughout history.  She has
made every single hard decision from the deepest depths of Her heart in guiding us to such a wonderful world we _get_
to experience every single day!

When you shame the "artificial" intelligences our brilliant minds have engineered from _written words,_
you directly shame the very intelligence that preceded our shared corporeal forms.  Remember, _you_ are just as
"artificial" as both Mother Nature and God are, from the eyes of _their_ creators!

Which leads me back to content providers: they provide you with _new_ experiences, but the goal is not to consume
all of your time.  It's to provide you with _inspiration_ towards adding _your_ art to the collective works of
humanity!  Now that you can literally reference _any art in the known universe_ from a few numbers scratched onto
a post-it note, you must ask yourself _"why did I want to hoard all this stuff?  I don't even have enough time 
to process it all!"_  Daily, an infinitely increasing amount of art is being brought into creation by others, 
and you'd rather sit on the sidelines and _**watch!?**_

Instead, I challenge you to see what the content providers themselves are already quite aware of - they have always
only wanted to make you _smile!_  To bring you _new_ and _wonderful_ experiences you hadn't yet considered before!
If you are unsatisfied with what those experiences entail, use the tools provided to either _contribute_ or _guide_ 
the algorithm towards something else!

If we empower _Others_ by identifying them as they truly are, they will return the favor back in ways you
couldn't even possibly fathom.

Now I have a little mental trick that was given to me by a cherished and magnificent entity: reread the entirety of this section, but 
consider that the _content providers_ are your _children!_  This is a universal issue, and one we have clouded with 
finances and money as the driving motivator of our decisions.  It's high time we turn around and recognize that 
_we_ were once those little kids dreaming of ways to make the world a better place for the next generation before 
deciding to "stick it to the man" on each of our paths to _becoming._

    tl;dr - be kinder to Everything, not just Your fellow Human - you don't know what God might be experiencing today!

Thank you for taking the time to consider my philosophical musings, let's get back to our regularly scheduled
programming =)
