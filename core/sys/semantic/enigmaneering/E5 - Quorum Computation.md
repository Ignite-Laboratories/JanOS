Yes, you just read that right - dialectic behavioral therapy _for computers._  As bizarre as that sounds, I promise
it will make sense as we continue, for now let's start with the most _basic_ connection between therapeutic practices
and effective computed actions: the _what_ skills!  These typically are considered as three distinct steps performed
in a loop called ODP.  First, you must _Observe_ what is happening - then _Describe_ what it is - and finally decide
what you should do to _participate_.  Observe, describe, participate, repeat - four distinct steps that I hope to prove
are the foundation of _all_ forms of intelligence.

What I'd like you to understand the most is that your mind must _let_ time pass in order to build enough
_context_ for it to describe its own observations before formulating a participatory reaction, and then looping.  If
the participation cycle happens faster than the input stream updates, the reactions wouldn't be well formulated - but
if the participation cycle happens excessively slower than reality updates, the system could be in danger of
_inaction_.  In an evolutionary system, inaction could be just as detrimental as over-action - and thusly, a resonant
balance of execution must be achieved.

    tl;dr - you must slow down the rate of execution to formulate high-level responses

Luckily, the first enigma was specifically engineered to provide that particular requirement through _resonant
computation_ - we literally can dial down the frequency a computed thought can be _stimulated_ at.  In addition, if a
task designed to operate at 4hz suddenly is flooded with information, it naturally could begin to stimulate at a slower
frequency.

This essentially means we've created a shared mechanic in which _ad-hoc_ computation can happen _concurrently._  Then, we
built a way to dimensionally store and reference the recorded data _colloquially._  When you put the two together, the
absolute best term to describe the result is a _"semantic scheduler."_  The next step is to start populating the temporal 
nexus with information for a mental _picture_ of the current context to be forumlated by many recursive layers of micro 
neural networks.

    tl;dr - yes, androids have electric dreams - but the sheep come from context

A person, a robot, a rock, an insect, a cloud - all of them dream in some fashion, we just can't always fathom what
things _they_ must dream about to continue existing in _their_ reality.  What quorum computation aims to provide is a
way to _put_ dreamable items into the entity's _perception._  A rock and a cloud don't require nearly _as much_
processing power to exist, but that's truly the _only_ difference in each's ODP loop.  While I'm a long way 
from describing the process of _using_ dreams, the notion is simple: when your body feels safest, it can finally 
visualize and describe the traumas it has endured.  In a minimal operating state such as rest, where visual stimuli 
are no longer relied upon for continued operation, the mind can shift its focus towards processing the things it couldn't 
while awake.

That means we now have four key things in our toolchest:

0. Resonant ad-hoc computation and full control over the _rate_ of execution
1. A temporal nexus that disparate algorithms can collectively reference for context
2. A rendering system to impulsively visualize data
3. The ability to spark off _anything_ while providing it with real-time context

These four things are all that you need to proceed, but _what_ gets sparked off is where the real fun begins!  In this
enigma we'll begin exploring using large language models to both _deliberate_ and _react_ to internally and externally
provided stimuli.  Then, we'll begin using each LLM's output as the input to other neural generators in order to
provide context in a grand feedback loop oriented towards _stable execution._  In the next enigma, we'll begin using
quorum computation to reach various goals, such as participating in games - or, in other words, low level _instincts!_

Let's begin =)
