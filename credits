While this project ENTIRELY relies upon the ideas and concepts put forth by those before us, there are several
-creative- components that need their due credit, honor, and respect:

WordNet 3.1 Database - Princeton University
NameDB - Kevin MacLeod, Incompetech.com
SurnameDB - The Internet Surname Database, surnamedb.com

SERIOUSLY!  If you wish to support this project, please support the creatives that facilitated its existence =)

In addition, I DEEPLY need to honor the fact that the Go language even exists in the first place!  My God, it's
EXACTLY what many of us have asked for since the day we collectively saw bits streaming through silicon.  In
writing my tools, I take great care to honor and respect the example they've set forth - THEIR mission, drive,
and ability to make the best decisions possible are, quite literally, a modern MIRACLE of existence.  THANK YOU!
