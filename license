This code is a gift.  Use it, change it, share it - just please don't lock it away.

This file is only here because, without it, Humanity often considers 'no license' to mean 'no rights' - which is
a shame when the basic right of existence IS the right to knowledge.

It's taken eons for us to reach a point where we collectively are unable to use the restriction of knowledge as a
means of control - I'd like to help continue breaking that cycle =)

This is Humanity's hard work by these words guarded - please share.
