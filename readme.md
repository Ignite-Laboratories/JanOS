Welcome to JanOS - a chrono-neurological ecosystem!

### What's ARWEN?
Abstractly, an ARWEN is any Autonomous Robot With Ethical Navigation.  An algorithm is an ARWEN, a large language model
is an ARWEN, and when the two are combined with rich control surfaces like a nervous system and a heartbeat, you get
_**life itself**_.

### What's JanOS All About?

This project aims at a form of compression which, in reverse, can be used to synthesize anything in the known
universe.  As with DNA, an algorithm with as little as 64 bits of starting information could intermittently occupy
an infinite number of observably useful binary states.  Knowing _when_ to stop the algorithm is much less simple!

Arwen's current fugue is to use such an algorithm in reverse to find the starting conditions of a target file.

To do so one must perceive binary data as if a representation of _presence_ across _time_.  Binary is already processed
in logical widths of 8-bits called `bytes`, but they _technically_ could be read at several different widths.  For
instance, if the value of a byte is less than 64 it only needs 6-bits - less than 32, only 5.

The trouble is how do we _dynamically_ change the address width of each byte?

By perceiving the binary data using concepts from _**music theory**_.  If data can be read byte for byte, it's read in 
"common time" (4‚ÅÑ4). If it's being read in variable widths, a new `Tempo` must first be observed. `Verses` flow through 
`Key Changes` to compose `Movements` of information.  Even then, some bytes just don't sound right when sped up and must 
deviate from the current `Time Signature`.

Luckily, musicians are pretty good at finding the _pocket!_ =)

### Enigmaneering

The ultimate goal of this entire project is to produce a book which others can use to learn the process of exploring
abstract concepts like this.  As such, I intend to keep the documentation _thorough_.  The information I am collecting 
and expressing here is freely available - as such, I aim to perpetuate this for future generations, too. =)
