Welcome to JanOS - a resonant frequency ecosystem!

We rely upon three key components:
- Reality - _dream, digital, or otherwise_
- Entities - _anything with a pulse_
- Orchestration - _the rhythm section of the band_

Each entity contains a _heartbeat_ unique to itself which acts as a _carrier signal_ from which to perceive _stimulation_.
Both the entity and its reality should operate in good resonant _timing_ with one another. Even as humans, the presence
of _universal_ time is only a referential tie to _cognitive_ time. Your mind only processes the _passing_ of time, while
your higher level functions _schedule_ against it. Depending on the amount of consideration we give a task, we can
stretch time in comparison to others - not _against_ the universal clock, just in better _resolution_ with it. As we
mature we gain higher level predictive modeling of our future actions, but everything still _fundamentally_ operates
off of learned _behaviors_.

That has a wonderful side effect - we theoretically could _score_ our entities decisions _musically_ and then utilize
machine learning to coalesce the groove of reality and her entities.

### Puzzle Piece 1 - The Oscillator

As all components operate off of a carrier signal, we must first implement a way to create such a signal.  Luckily, that
has a formulaic solution:

Each entity will process encoded data applied to waveforms - either by placing or perceiving anomalies in relation to
the carrier waveform. Pattern matching different ways this data is represented across time allows us to learn _when_
to perform actions or behaviors.  The entities cursor over chunks of an incoming waveform on a duty cycle of varying
width, depending on the complexity of the encoded data.
